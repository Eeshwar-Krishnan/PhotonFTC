## Classes Overview

### PhotonDcMotor

- **Purpose**: This class extends the functionality of a DC motor by providing asynchronous operations.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Asynchronous Methods**: Allows fetching motor properties like current, power, and PID coefficients asynchronously.
  - **Enhanced Control**: Offers methods to get the corrected motor current and check if the motor is enabled asynchronously.
- **Why Needed**: It improves the responsiveness and control of the robot by leveraging asynchronous programming, which is crucial for real-time robotics applications.

### PhotonCRServo

- **Purpose**: Extends the `CRServoImplEx` class to provide asynchronous control over continuous rotation servos.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Async Direction and Power**: Methods to get the servo's direction and power asynchronously.
- **Why Needed**: Asynchronous control allows for smoother and more responsive servo operations, which is essential in robotics for precise movements.

### PhotonServo

- **Purpose**: Provides asynchronous control for standard servos.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Async Position**: Methods to check if PWM is enabled and get the servo position asynchronously.
- **Why Needed**: Enhances servo control by allowing operations to be performed without blocking the main thread, which is vital for maintaining performance in complex robotics tasks.

### PhotonLynxServoController

- **Purpose**: Manages servos connected to a Lynx module, providing asynchronous operations for servo control.
- **Key Features**:
  - **PWM Control**: Asynchronously checks if PWM is enabled and retrieves servo positions.
- **Why Needed**: Provides non-blocking operations that help in managing multiple servos efficiently in a robotics application.

### PhotonAdvancedDcMotor

- **Purpose**: Provides advanced control features for DC motors.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Cache Tolerance**: Allows setting a tolerance level for motor power changes to avoid unnecessary updates.
  - **Refresh Rate Control**: Manages how frequently motor power updates occur to optimize performance.
- **Why Needed**: Offers fine-grained control over motor operations, which is crucial for optimizing power usage and performance in competitive robotics.

### PhotonLynxCommandListener

- **Purpose**: Interface for listening to Lynx commands and their responses.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Command Handling**: Methods to handle commands and responses from the Lynx module.
- **Why Needed**: Essential for monitoring and reacting to command execution in real-time, ensuring that the robot's operations are synchronized and efficient.
